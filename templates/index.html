      The inspiration of this project came from many different places, ranging from being asked to wear ugly company t-shirts, to seeing awesome other code-built clothes. Cyberdog has a <a href="https://www.cyberdog.net/products/glitch-dress">HTML glitch dress</a> of their website which looks amazing (I have one). The excelent folks at <a href="https://svahausa.com/">Svaha have a line of (non-glitch) code dresses covering many programming languages</a> (along with a <a href="https://svahausa.com/products/spark-scala-fit-flare-rosalind-dress?variant=27996711911511">Spark Scala dress I'm biased towards</a>). <a href="https://shenovafashion.com/">Shenova fashion</a> have a line of women in STEM dresses which is also amazing.

      While these are all amazing, I think there is something unique about being able to wear your own work, and my hope is that some dress wearing folks will take advantage of this (or this idea) to showcase their own work on their dresses. Go forth and have fun :)

      You can keep up with the latest project's from <a href="https://twitter.com/holdenkarau">Holden Karau by following her on twitter, most of which is working on Apache Spark or riding her scooter</a>. If you want to improve the dress generator, or maybe make our website look less like the 90s, you can <a href="https://github.com/holdenk/clothes-from-code">look at the clothes from code project</a> on GitHub. Curious to see how this was built? Well thankfully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUbgxMqp27U&list=PLRLebp9QyZtZbvWShW9oazZz9bDc9SoQP">most of this was streamed and is recorded</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/holdenkarau">Holden's YouTube</a>.
